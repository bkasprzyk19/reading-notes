From the Duckett JS book:

JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”


# Errors and handling

-JS processes one line of code at a time. When a statement needs data from another function, it stacks the new function on top of the current task. 

## Execution Context and hoisting
- 1) prepare
- the new scrop is created
- variables, functions, and arguments are created

- 2) Execute
- now it can assign values to variables
- reference functions and run their code
- execute statements.

# #SSCOPEE

- *Functions are said to have lexical scope. They are linked to the object key they were defined within.

- for each execution context,the scope is the current execution context's variables object, plus the variables object for each parent execution context



# * **this is a large chapter to summarize so I will just provide summary** *

-  if you understand execution context (two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find code errors

- debuggings means finding errors

- use the console to help narrow down the area of the error.

- JS has 7 types of errors . and i know ill probably find them all so i dont have to worry, well get acquainted.
