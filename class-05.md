## Reading

-Here are the chapters to read/skim before Class 5:

### From the Duckett HTML book:

- Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
- Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
- Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)


## Block elements always appear on a new line

## Inline elements sit within a block leevel element and do not start a new line

``` html
<img src="images/birds/blackbird.png">

align: left or right

align: top or bottom pr middle

```

## *Images*

- Save as right type of file (.png, .jpeg, .gif)


- try to save as the same sive as whats being used on your webpage


- Consider using Adobe photoshop to help curate your images


Whenever you have a colorful photograph, you should be sure to save it in the .jpeg catagory.


- .gif and .png are for lesser quality images or images without a lot of color changes that dont require the same precision as a jpeg




## PGS 117 on Animated gifs and transparency
- consult them




## *COLOR* can really bring a page to life.

- RGB / Hex codes / color names to call your fav colors.

- PG 254 has solid examplkes of contrast and opacity





# *TYPEFACE* TERMINOLOGY

SERIF is my preference

Or light cursive

The text in the type chaptor is extremely helpful, I'm going to be using this for reference for many things now as this was an area i was struggling in.
