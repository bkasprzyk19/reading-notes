# events


## interactions trigger events
//
## events trigger code
//
## code responds to user


*events occur when users click or tap on a link, hover or swipe over an element, type on a keyboard, resize a window, etc.*

**THE SELECTION OF EVENT TYPES ON PAGE 246 WILL HELP WITH FUNCTION BUILDING**

``` javascript

element.oneevent = functionName;

function checkUsername(){
var el = document.}getElementById('username');
el.onblur = checkUsername;
;

element.addEvent =Listener('event', functionName [, Boolean]);




```

## event bubbline vs event capturing

*see diagram on page 260*

- Event handlers / listeners can be bound to the containing  li, ul, body, html elements, plus the document object, and the window object. The order in which the events fire is known as the *event flow*



# **Event Delegation**

HTML5 vs mutation events vs form events vs keyboard events vs mouse events vs focus & blur events vs user interface events
