What is node.js?

event-based”, “non-blocking”, “asynchronous I/O” runtime built on Chromnes V8 Engine

In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

Its a way to run JavaScript in the chromium based web browsers. 

"the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods."

"is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute."

What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

"This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers."

What is npm?

"In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry."

What version of node are you running on your machine?

v14.17.3

What version of npm are you running on your machine?

7.24.0

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

npm install -g jshint

What is node used for?

This will install the jshint package globally on your system. We can use it to lint the index.js file from the previous example:

jshint index.js

You should now see a number of ES6-related errors. If you want to fix them up, add /* jshint esversion: 6 */ to the top of the index.js file, re-run the command and linting should pass.





What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

- greater efficiency
- engaged collaboration
- learning from fellow students
- social skills
- job interview readiness
- work environment rediness

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

learning from fellow students. This is ultimately the greatest reward to me. I learn better by having it explained in different ways and each student i talk to has another perspective on something that usually helps me to better understand it as well.

How does pair programming work?

One driver and one navigator usually to avoid working on the same piece of code. Work together on everything just seperate the tasks of coding it in to only the driver.
