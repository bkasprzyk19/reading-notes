Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
# SQL        

- Relational DB
- Table based     
- predefined schema
- vertically scaleable (get that horsepower baby)
- sql means structured query language for defining and manipulating the data

vs

# NoSQL

- Distributed Database 	 
- document based, key-value pairs, graph, or wide-column store.
- dynamic schema for unstructured data 	 
- horizontally scalable ( (i feel the need for more... servers))
- queries are focused on collection of documents
 	 
 	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

complex data

Give a real world example.

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

not complex data? i couldnt find the answer to this

Give a real world example.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

noSQL

Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL


"SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb"


Videos


sql vs nosql (Video)


What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language

What is a realational database?

We have a DB which works with certain assumptions which supports the SQ language.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?

Tables, Fields, Columns, Products

What is a ‘schema’?

all records in a table have to adhere to the schema, which is basically the directions of the table.

What is a NoSQL database?

databases full of collections  which contain documents (basically the rows of the table), they dont have to use the same schema. you can have multiple docs in a collection with different fields. 

Howo does it work?

it lets you store whatever type of document with minimal to no relations into a collection. i suppose you will have to deal with the varied response data on the return request.

What is inside of a Mongo database?

its humongous, no turn around, there is sooo muchhhh dattttaaaaaaaaa aaghghghhhhhhhhhhh..................

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

There is no clear winner, it depends on what you are storing. It would appears MongoDB is more flexible.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

dealing with non schema data on the retur which is not predictable.




Overall I thought this video was good but the way the presenter broadcasted the types of relations was very confusing, he could have used some better examples.
