## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

https://rapidapi.com/blog/put-vs-patch/

Put and Patch according to this reference are the following:

- Put is a method
- client sends data that updates the entire resource. 
- need to send the entire resource you wish to update

- Patch applies partial updates
- Only send data you wish to update.
