## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

- ensure server functionality 
- shape your code to meet the tests that you set out before building the files
- incorporate the larger problem solving approach 

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- before each is run before each test in a describe
- after each is run after each test in a describe


## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

- downside of test driven development can limit your development to just be focusing on meeting the test requirements instead of possibly having more creativity and just using whatever method best fits to build your function.

2.	It was introduced in 2009.	It was introduced in 2015.
3.	It supports primitive data types that are string, number, boolean, null, and undefined. 	In ES6, there are some additions to JavaScript data types. It introduced a new primitive data type ‘symbol’ for supporting unique values.
4.	There are only one way to define the variables by using the var keyword.	There are two new ways to define variables that are let and const.
5.	It has a lower performance as compared to ES6.	It has a higher performance than ES5.
6.	Object manipulation is time-consuming in ES5.	Object manipulation is less time-consuming in ES6.
7.	In ES5, both function and return keywords are used to define a function.	An arrow function is a new feature introduced in ES6 by which we don’t require the function keyword to define the function.
