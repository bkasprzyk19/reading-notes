I don't its odd that Rozovsku's study group experiences were polarized on the scale of how they performed. I think this is common. I have been in many groups that have succeeded and also many groups that have failed, or have not come in first place.

- 2012: Project Aristotle - study hundreds of google's teams.

- group norms impacted a teams effectivness in the biggest way

- google made efforts to influence the group norms
-needed to find out which norms were the best
